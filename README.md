### PROJECT OVERVIEW

 ***This data analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data using tools such as Excel, SQL and Power BI. By leveraging these platforms I gained hand-on experience in manipulating datasets, performing advanced queries and creating interactive  visualizations, The project enabled a deeper understanding of data analysis techniques and tools, equipping me with the skills neccessary to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions***

### DATA SOURCE

 ***The primary source of data used in this project is obtained from an open-source platform, The data is publicly available and can be freely downloaded from reputable online repositories such as Kaggle [Download Here](https://www.kaggle.com) or other trusted data repositories. These platforms offer diverse datasets that are widely used for research, analysis and educational purposes***.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  This phase involved exploring of the data to answer some specific questions, including:
  - ## ***calculating SUM and AVERAGE Values, using functions such as***:
```
 =sum(A1:A35)
 =AVERAGE(A1:A35)
```
    
- ## ***Identifying Top Ten Highest and Lowest Sallers***,using functions like:
```
 =MAXIFS(range, criteria_range, criteria)
 =MINIFS(range, criteria_range, criteria)
```

 ### Data Analysis
 This section we included basic lines of code or queries or even some of the Database expressions[DAX] used during data analysis;
 
 ---SQL Example---
    
 ```
  SELECT * FROM TABLE
 WHERE CONDITION =TRUE
```
