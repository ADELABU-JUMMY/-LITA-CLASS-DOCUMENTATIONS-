### PROJECT OVERVIEW

## This data analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data using tools such as Excel, SQL and Power BI. By leveraging these platforms I gained hand-on experience in manipulating datasets, performing advanced queries and creating interactive  visualizations, The project enabled a deeper understanding of data analysis techniques and tools, equipping me with the skills neccessary to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions

### DATA SOURCE

## The primary source of data used in this project is obtained from an open-source platform, The data is publicly available and can be freely downloaded from reputable online repositories such as Kaggle [Download Here](https://www.kaggle.com) or other trusted data repositories. These platforms offer diverse datasets that are widely used for research, analysis and educational purposes.

### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel [dowload Here](https://www.microsoft.com) 
1. For data cleaning
2. For Analysis
3. For data visualization

  - SQL-STRUCTURE QUERY LANGUAGE for Querying Data

 ### Data Cleaning and Preparations
  In the inital phase of the data cleaning and preparations we performed the following actions
  
1. Data Loading and Inspection
 2. Handling missing variables
 3. Data cleaning and formatting

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  It involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as
  - getting the sum and Average values using the SUM,AVERAGE fuunctions e.g 
```
 =sum(A1:A35) =AVERAGE(A1:A35)
```
    
- getting the top ten highest and lowest sallers using the MAXIFS,MINIFS functions

 ---
 ### Data Analysis
 This is where we include basic lines of code or queries or even some of the Database expressions[DAX] used during data analysis;
 
 ---SQL---
    
 ```
  SELECT * FROM TABLE
 WHERE CONDITION =TRUE
```
